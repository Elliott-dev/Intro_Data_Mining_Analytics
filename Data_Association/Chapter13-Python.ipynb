    "In this notebook, you will learn how to use association to identify patterns within datasets, such as the items a customer often purchases together at a grocery store, the links on a Web site upon which a customer clicks before making a purchase, and the snacks a fan purchases together at a ballgame.\n",

    "As you will learn, one of the most well-known association applications is the shopping-cart problem, which identifies the association between buying diapers and beer. You can think of this association process as looking in each shopping cart as customers leave the market and taking note of the items they bought. By noting that many of the carts that contained diapers also contained beer, you form an association. Data analysts often refer to this process as Market-Basket Analysis."
