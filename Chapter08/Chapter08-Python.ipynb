    "Python is an open-source programming language, widely used for Web applications, data mining, and machine learning. Depending on the category (most in demand, most popular, best to know, and so on), Python is one of the top programming languages. Python is an interpreted programming language for which the Python interpreter processes Python code one statement at a time, as opposed to a compiled language (such as Java or C#), for which the language compiler converts the program’s source code into an executable file. An advantage of Python’s interpreted environment is that you can execute Python statements one at a time, interactively using the interpreter. "
